## Overview

This directory contains substantive article collections exploring the intersection of design practice, leadership, and AI collaboration. Each collection examines a specific theme through multiple lenses—theoretical, practical, and applied—providing both conceptual frameworks and actionable guidance.

<summary><strong>📖 More Context</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

The articles here represent distilled insights from active design leadership practice in 2024, a year of rapid AI tool evolution. Rather than tutorial content or quick tips, these are explorations of deeper questions: How do we maintain authentic creative practice? What workflows actually support design-AI collaboration? How do we evaluate value beyond traditional metrics?

Each article collection is structured to support different reading styles—you can dive deep into complete series or extract specific practical guidance as needed. Supporting materials (research, assets, drafts) are included to show the thinking behind published work.

## 🏗️ Organization

<details>
<summary><strong>Structure & Logic</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

### Organizational Approach

**Chronological with thematic clustering:** Article collections are organized by initial publication date (YYMMDD prefix) but may contain multiple pieces spanning weeks or months.

Collections evolve organically—a single article may expand into a series as themes develop. The date prefix indicates when the collection began, not when it completed.

### Naming Convention

Collections use YYMMDD-descriptive-name format:
- **YYMMDD prefix:** Publication date of first article in collection (240927, 241012, etc.)
- **Descriptive name:** Core theme or topic (on-authenticity, git-github-setup)
- **Multiple articles:** Collections may contain numbered or dated sub-articles

### Content Types

Articles in this directory include:
- 📄 Essays - Long-form theoretical explorations
- 🎓 Tutorials - Step-by-step practical guides
- 📖 Case studies - Real-world application examples
- 📊 Analysis - Data-driven examinations
- 🔍 Series - Multi-part thematic explorations

Each collection may blend multiple types to provide comprehensive coverage of its theme.
