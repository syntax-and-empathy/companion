## Overview

This article collection explores what it means to do authentic creative work in an age of AI collaboration. Starting with theoretical questions about algorithmic performance and culminating in practical frameworks, these pieces trace a journey from skepticism through implementation to new paradigms for evaluating creative partnerships.

<summary><strong>📖 More Context</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

This collection emerged from real experience leading design teams through AI tool adoption in 2024. Rather than treating AI as simply another tool, these articles grapple with deeper questions: What makes work "yours"? How do we evaluate value when productivity metrics miss the point? When does AI collaboration enhance versus diminish creative authenticity?

The articles are designed to be read in sequence but work independently. They progress from identifying problems (algorithmic theatre, measurement paradoxes) through practical implementation (collaboration crash course) to real-world application (new venue case study).

## 🗺️ Navigation Guide

### Where to Start

**If you're looking for practical guidance:** Start with [1010-crash-course-collaboration/](./1010-crash-course-collaboration/) for actionable frameworks you can implement immediately

**If you're interested in the theoretical foundation:** Begin with [0927-algorithmic-theatre/](./0927-algorithmic-theatre/) to understand the authenticity questions

**If you want to see real-world application:** Jump to [1101-new-venue-victory/](./1101-new-venue-victory/) for a concrete case study

**If you want the complete journey:** Read chronologically from 0901 through 1109

### How to Explore

- 📅 **Chronologically:** Articles build on each other, with later pieces referencing earlier concepts
- 🎯 **By interest:** Each article stands alone with sufficient context
- 📊 **Data-first:** Start with 0901 if you prefer quantitative grounding
- 🔧 **Practice-first:** Jump to 1010 if you want hands-on guidance immediately

**💡 Tip:** Each article directory contains its own README with summaries, reading guides, and key takeaways

## 🏗️ Organization

<details>
<summary><strong>Structure & Logic</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

### Organizational Approach

**Sequential/Chronological:** Articles are organized by publication date (MMDD format) and designed to build on each other, though each stands alone.

The collection progresses through three movements:
1. **Problem identification** (0901, 0927) - What's wrong with current approaches?
2. **Practical response** (1010, 1101) - How to do it better?
3. **New framework** (1109) - How should we think about this differently?

### Naming Convention

Articles use MMDD-descriptive-title format:
- MMDD prefix indicates publication date (September-November 2024)
- Descriptive titles capture the core concept or question

### Content Types

This collection includes:
- 📊 Data analysis (0901) - Quantitative examination of AI collaboration metrics
- 📄 Essays (0927, 1109) - Long-form explorations of theoretical questions
- 🎓 Tutorials (1010) - Practical implementation guides
- 📖 Case studies (1101) - Real-world application examples
