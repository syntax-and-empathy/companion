## How to Navigate

### Recommended Path

**For the complete experience:**
1.  Start with [`q1-ai-trials.md`](q1-ai-trials.md) to understand the initial experimental setup and baseline performance.
2.  Then explore [`q2-ai-trials.md`](q2-ai-trials.md), [`q3-ai-trials.md`](q3-ai-trials.md), and [`q4-ai-trials.md`](q4-ai-trials.md) sequentially to follow the experiment's progression and iterative improvements.
3.  Review [`meta.yml`](meta.yml) for project-level metadata and a quick overview.

### Alternative Paths

**If you're short on time:** Read the 'TL;DR' and 'Key Takeaways' sections of this README, then browse the summaries within each quarterly report for key insights.
**If you're looking for specific information:** Use the table of contents within each `.md` file, or search across the files for terms like 'bias', 'prompt engineering', or specific holiday names.
**If you want visual context first:** The reports are primarily text-based analysis. Focus on the 'Key Takeaways' for summary points.

**Tip:** Each quarterly report builds on the previous one, so a chronological reading order is recommended for a full understanding of the experiment's evolution.
