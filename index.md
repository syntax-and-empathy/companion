Most AI guidance for designers is either generic tips disguised as magic prompts, single-use solutions that ignore ethics, or dense technical docs written for developers. They don't explain foundational elements or how they combine to create reusable modules for predictable results. That the resulting patterns form frameworks that serve as dependable workflows.

Sound familiar? It should. It's how systems design works.

## Systems Design for Human-AI Collaboration

Syntax & Empathy focuses on structured frameworks and workflow optimizations for Product, Service, and User Experience designers using ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other LLMs. The work overlaps with documentation, product management, research, and writing.

**Prompt Engineering Building Blocks** help you keep AI conversations on task and recover when human-to-machine translation falls apart. You'll understand why certain approaches consistently work while others fail.

**Modular Frameworks for Design Work** combine techniques that inform ideation and discovery. They create contextual roles for specific tasks and specify how to design research studies or synthesize results.

**Systematic Workflow Integrations** provide pattern libraries for common UX tasks and templates you can adapt to your process. Approaches for building what works across teams and projects.

**Ethical Implementation** runs throughout everything. I discuss and apply bias detection methods, iterative review processes, and fact-checking best practices to ensure responsible AI use.
