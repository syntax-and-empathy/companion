## Overview

This repository documents my journey exploring AI collaboration in design practice—from year-long experimentation through distilled insights, practical frameworks, and technical implementations. It's designed for design professionals navigating the evolving landscape of AI-assisted creative work.

<summary><strong>📖 More Context</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

### The Challenge

We're in a unique moment where AI tools are powerful enough to meaningfully augment creative work, but most guidance is either purely technical (for developers) or surface-level (generic prompting tips). Design professionals need something in between: technically grounded but contextually relevant to creative practice.

### The Approach

Rather than prescriptive tutorials, this repository offers frameworks, real examples, and documented experimentation. The goal is to help you develop your own informed practice, not copy mine. You'll find:

- Long-form explorations of deeper questions (authenticity, measurement, value)
- Practical frameworks you can adapt to your context
- Technical workflows optimized for designers
- Raw experimentation history showing what worked (and didn't)

### Who This Is For

This repository serves several audiences:
- **Design leaders** navigating AI tool adoption in teams
- **Creative professionals** developing AI collaboration practices
- **UX practitioners** interested in prompt engineering and AI workflows
- **Anyone curious** about thoughtful integration of AI in creative work

## 🏗️ Organization

<details>
<summary><strong>Structure & Logic</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

### Organizational Philosophy

This repository uses a **numbered directory structure** (00-, 01-, 02-, etc.) to maintain clear organization as content grows. Numbers indicate broad categories, not strict hierarchies:

- **00-series:** Foundational resources
- **01-series:** Historical/archival content
- **02-series:** Primary published content
- **03-series:** Applied implementations
- **04+ series:** Experimental or specialized content

Within each category, content organizes by date or theme as appropriate.

### Naming Conventions

- **Directories:** Numbered prefix + descriptive name (02-articles, 01-archive)
- **Article collections:** YYMMDD-descriptive-name (251109-on-authenticity)
- **Individual articles:** MMDD-descriptive-name or descriptive-name.md
- **Templates:** descriptive-name.md (no dates, meant to be timeless)

### Content Evolution

This is a living repository. Content evolves:
- Single articles may expand into series
- Experiments become polished frameworks
- Raw notes evolve into published pieces
- The structure adapts as themes emerge

Dates indicate origin, not finality. A "251109" collection may continue to grow.

## 💡 About This Repository

### Why "Companion"?

This repository is a companion to active design practice—not a textbook or tutorial series, but a documented journey. It captures thinking in progress, experiments that failed, and frameworks that evolved. The goal is to show the actual process of developing AI collaboration practices, not just the polished results.

### Philosophy

Three principles guide this work:

1. **Authenticity over performance** - Real exploration, not polished perfection
2. **Frameworks over prescriptions** - Tools to develop your practice, not rules to follow
3. **Context over abstraction** - Grounded in design practice, not generic advice
