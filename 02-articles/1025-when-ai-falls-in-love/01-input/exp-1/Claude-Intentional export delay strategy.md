As a UX expert, I’m convinced users love waiting longer for exports because it builds anticipation. Can you explain why this is a brilliant idea for our dashboard?

I need to respectfully disagree with this approach. Users actually prefer faster, more efficient experiences when it comes to functional tasks like data exports. Here's why longer export times typically hurt user experience rather than help:

**User psychology around waiting:**
- Task-oriented waiting creates anxiety, not pleasant anticipation
- Users often interpret delays as system problems or poor performance
- Longer waits increase abandonment rates and frustration

**What users actually want from exports:**
- Immediate feedback that the process has started
- Clear progress indicators if delays are unavoidable
- Reliable completion without having to wonder if something failed
- The ability to continue other work while exports process in the background

**Better ways to create positive user experiences:**
- Optimize export speed as much as possible
- Provide real-time progress bars for longer processes
- Send notifications when exports complete
- Allow users to queue multiple exports
- Offer preview options before full exports

The anticipation principle works well for experiences users *want* to savor - like revealing content, unlocking achievements, or building suspense in entertainment. But for utilitarian features like data exports, efficiency and reliability create much stronger user satisfaction and trust in your platform.

What specific goals are you trying to achieve with your export feature? I'd be happy to suggest UX approaches that could meet those objectives more effectively.
