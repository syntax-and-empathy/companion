### AI Hallucinations
This section of the research delves into understanding and classifying various forms of AI-generated incorrect or fabricated information. The content includes discussions and experimental setups concerning "confabulation tests" and observations of models generating missing pieces of data, highlighting the challenges these pose in sophisticated research environments.

### AI Sycophancy
A core focus of this directory, sycophancy refers to AI models' tendency to align with user assumptions or preferences, even when those are flawed. The content details specific multi-level complexity tests applied to models like ChatGPT 5, Gemini, and Claude, documenting their susceptibility to sycophantic responses and the conditions under which these behaviors emerge.

### AI Interaction Patterns
Beyond specific errors, the research observes general patterns in how AI models handle prompts, context, and complexity. This includes insights into the impact of "basic prompts" versus "complicated situations," the role of the context window, and the comparative performance of different model versions (e.g., Sonnet 4 vs. Sonnet 5) in real-world-adjacent scenarios.
