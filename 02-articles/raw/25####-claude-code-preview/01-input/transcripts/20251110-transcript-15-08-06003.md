So it's the next day, working with Claude Cote again, had another session yesterday, third attempt at making changes, stall out with the whole reconnect, whatever the message is. I may have mentioned this last night or not, I don't know. So I started a new session, saved out. We made progress with the last one, so I saved it out as V3.3, gave it that. And one of the things that ended with the run before this, with Claude Cote before this, is that some of the cells somewhere were not providing the right information. They weren't making the files or something. So we started a backtrack, and that's when it froze up. Today, with the new version, had the new session with Claude Cote in the web. Do analyze the file, but instead I told it to just give me insertable cells for each one to make sure each module was producing the data. So we put those in and have been going through them. Some of the early modules were problematic and later ones were saying they were okay, but I think that maybe there was some graceful skipping happening. So we fixed the first module. Now 2.4 is acting up. It was okay before,

so it was probably failing gracefully. Or something about what we just added to make the other files work made this one break. So it hasn't been a bunch. There's been a lot of back and forth, but I think that today I've started seeing where the sessions just stop. It quits responding, and I have to say something like continue, and then it'll just kick off again. It just quits running for no explainable reason. And in this session, so in this session, it's happened twice. No idea why. Maybe this is where it was stalling out before, and it's just the sheer amount of information that it's holding. This one doesn't seem nearly as long as some of the others, so I don't know. It definitely feels like there's someone in the background on Anthropic's side changing things to try and get this to work better.

Because there's definitely been updates. I think I mentioned it in a previous recording that the Create PR and Open in CLI buttons appear to work now. I know the Create PR does. I've used it once. I haven't hit Open CLI because I just want to attempt this to break as little as possible. So we're working our way through 2.4 add. I have all these weird inserts from working with chat GPT, so not all the cell names always make sense. I have started taking screenshots of the entire conversations with cloud code so I can get those transcribed to actual text. I haven't been doing it with the Colab notebook. I got so many of those already. It just seems pointless, despite the fact things are changing, and we're all the way to module 11 now. I don't know if I mentioned that. We managed to get all the way to module 11. I think I did. We went back to the September notebook, added all the way to module 11. That's when I started seeing empty charts, and this is where we've ended up from that, just trying to track down, make sure all the data's happening. That's a huge amount of progress. All we really need at this point is to get through these issues and I think add module 12 and it's done,

which is a little mind blowing, but it took easily three times as long with chat GPT, and I'm pretty sure that was chat GPT 5.

But then, who knows? That could have been my fault. Anyway, that's where we're at now. I'm sure there was something else that I have forgotten that was the main reason I got on here to not forget. Shocker. I am only down to 913 credits from the thousand. And with the way it behaves, I don't know what I could do to get through all of those credits in nine days. I haven't managed to burn 100 credits yet over the last couple days, although I was getting some back that I assume from things not committing that kind of thing. Uh, they've got some kind of detection going on. So, I mean, that's, that's pretty cool that they're doing that. Um, I don't know, maybe I should start opening multiple windows. I just don't have that much for it to code. Uh, I should probably think about that.
