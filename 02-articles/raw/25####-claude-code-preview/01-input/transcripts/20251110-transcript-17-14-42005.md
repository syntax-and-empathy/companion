It feels really small to add this, silly anyway. Cloud is automatically updating the tool updates, cloud web, which usually I have to tell it to do that, so that's pretty cool. And I'm also noticing that the create PR and open in CLI buttons appear to be active now. And I'm not going to mess with them. Well, at least not now. We'll see what happens once it's done something, some significant amount of work. But I think it's going to keep committing anyway. And I don't need to do a pull request from the feature thing it just made. So, I don't know.
