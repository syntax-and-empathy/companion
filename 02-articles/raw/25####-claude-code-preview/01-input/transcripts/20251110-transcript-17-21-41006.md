So my last message was or last transcript was this morning. It is Sunday, November 9th, 530. I'm about to call it a night and play some Destiny 2, I guess. So in a unexpected turn of events, Cloud Code and the web has continued to get better over the last few days. I'm not sure what is making the difference, but in some sessions it stalls out and tells me to retry a connection and it never manages to connect again. In others, like the last one, it showed me that like three times and then just reconnected on its own. I didn't even touch the window because I was doing something else. So that's been pretty great. But as I wrapped up the last of my articles on the authenticity tool, I ended up going to it and saying, okay, if it's not going to work on this other thing, the SEO project, then I'd try it with that. With version three, that is not the version 1.3 that I'll be writing about in this article. So it turns out that we finished it today. Had a start yesterday, had a small start yesterday, but finished it today. It had taken me, I don't know how many hours with Chet GPT-5. And keep in mind, this is using Chet GPT-5 in browser windows. I was not using IDEs and stuff at that time, unfortunately. Of course, I don't think I had the ability to use it through an IDE at that time. Maybe it wouldn't have made a difference. Or maybe I thought that would be the fun experiment, whatever. That's another entire article. But what took it, probably the sum of days after some bumps because of the preview version of Claude Code stumbling a few times, we have finished it and I've downloaded all the stuff and it's just mind blowing. Some of these visualizations, I don't even know what some of these mean. And to be fair, this was three roles that I had made in Chet GPT-5 or made for Chet GPT-5. I don't think I used it to write them. But I had the expert on doing semantic and lingual lexiconical measurements. I had the Python developer and I had the code reviewer. So the first one, the expert mapped out everything. All 12 modules stuck to that plan to this day. I had it write a roadmap. And then each module working with Chet GPT was so difficult that there were places where I was skipping small fixes and things like that. So I actually have notes after each one of those modules that I would put into the project to further the knowledge of each Chet session in there. So I have all those and I put those into the repository that Claude pulled from. So it had knowledge of the first several modules. It still repeated some of the mistakes that we had started with Chet GPT, but in one of my prior transcripts it'll cover how I change the direction there. But yeah, it works. I think this is a weird position to be in. I'm about to finish up the article on 1.3. I want to publish all this to GitHub, which is another series that I'm just at the beginning of. I'm about to get the first one of those out. There's actually a backwards fork because this feeds into the experience with Chet GPT that I don't want to put in the same article as this because I'm going to do this one about just the Claude code because it just came out. So it's really cool. It's cool to have gotten into this preview this early and to have this experience of it starting really rocky, having a functionality that wasn't even in place in the UI, and watching all that change over the course of a few days. So that's really cool. That was really exciting. And so there's like two other series, one that goes backwards, one that goes forwards, that I guess I'm going to have to double down on finishing because I want to publish all of this stuff to the GitHub site that I'm standing up. I wasn't planning on putting it up until I'd made it make its own HTML. Well, not GitHub, but one of these. Maybe that's what I'll do with Claude code next. It's probably what I'll do with Claude code next now that I've set it. But I think that this stuff's going to have to go out and mark down because what it will give me is a fun kind of ending. Right now, the ending says something. It's somewhere along the lines of understanding what measurements really tell me is really all I needed. Which is true. I don't really worry about how much AI and how much of me is in a final article. If I can read it, and I'm happy with it, it's good enough. I've had enough people tell me I'm a perfectionist, that if I'm happy enough to let that thing go out with my name on it, it's fucking good enough. Even if other people feel like it's AI slop. So that's it. I've actually got version three done. It's crazy. I don't even know what some of those visualizations mean. I don't even know how to read some of them. I know how to read the charts. I just don't know what the information is. So I've got a bunch of reading to do there because I want to know, of course. I always want to know. But that is the ending of my first real project with Cloud Code Web preview.
