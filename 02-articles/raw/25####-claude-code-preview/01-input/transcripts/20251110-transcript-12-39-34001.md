Today, I might have gotten it today, I might have gotten it in the last few days, but today I noticed that I had an email about Claude code being in the web browser now. So I went ahead and decided to take that for a spin. They gave me $1,000 in credits, so I don't know how long I get to keep that. So let's knock that out of the park. The first task I decided to do was to have it reverse the direction that my Gmail collector works. Currently, the Gmail collector will check my email, look for certain addresses that emails came from, and perform a number of tasks like forward it to my Readwise account so that I can listen to it later, archive it, save a copy locally. It only does markdown, but that's really all I need. And apply labels, which helps me decide what I am absolutely going to look at, what I might look at, and what I'm kidding myself thinking I'm going to look at it, but I'm going to end up tossing it in a week. So I decided I wanted to be able to apply a label on the other side and have the Gmail collector pull those emails down and save a copy and do whatever else I wanted to do. And so I decided to start with that. I had Claude create a feature branch, no problem. Had it perform the work with minimal instruction, really. It went. It performed the tasks. There were a few things that I didn't expect, and maybe I overlooked something when I was activating it, but I don't think that's the case. So I asked it if it could make a plan, if I could use planning mode like you can use in the IDE VS code. And it said it could make a plan, and it did the to-do list and everything, but I didn't see any way to actually trigger that. But it did the plan. It had a three-phase plan, and then it asked me if I was ready, and I told it to go ahead, and it started going through the plan. But at the end of each phase, it just automatically committed. It didn't ask if I wanted it to commit or whatnot. And because it made the feature branch, maybe that was the expectation. I usually make the branches myself locally, so it went through the entire process. It made a total of three commits and pushed them. It pushed each. But it didn't merge back into main. It did ask me at least one time if I was ready to merge back into main, and I ran the tool. I wanted to run the tool before I was going to do that, so I did that. And then I noticed that it had done a few things that were surprising because it had already looked at the entire folder, and it had spoken to some of the things that were already there. But it created the example configuration in the Gmail folder, not in the Settings folder. It created the overview of the work it had done, it had documented it in root instead of the Gmail folder or updating the configuration guide that I have with the settings that covers all the others. So I asked it why it had done these other things. And it was straightforward, so it didn't try to make excuses or anything. And it didn't get sycophantically apologetic, which was nice. So I had it do some of the updates, and it was a bit silly of a mistake, a little foolish mistake. But when I ran it, I noticed that it wasn't being reported with all the other rules. Because I get a little summary after I run it, it tells me each of the rules that it looked at, how many actions were performed, and a few other things. And so I asked about that. And after two or three responses, Claude asked me to run a command, I ran the command, and it pointed out that I needed to pull the things it had committed. So that was silly. Funny, but I should know better than that by now. Of course, I'm not a developer. I don't work with this stuff regularly, so I don't know what I'm doing. I know more than the average bearer, I guess. But then I started asking it a few other things. And it couldn't find one of the other files. It's not uncommon to see a problem with a tool in Claude code and PS code. But it was seeing a lot of that, too, on the web version, which, I mean, maybe it's nothing, but it did seem a little surprising to me, because it's not even having to deal with my environment or my connection or anything like that. But to be fair, and all of this, to be fair, it is a beta. And they just started doing the research. So it's literally research preview right there next to Claude code. So I mean, there's going to be things like that. I think it was just that that one was a little surprising. Some of the other things that I found interesting about the interface itself, it has two chat boxes. One of them seems to be to create new sessions. And one of them is to actually have the conversation and the coding session. But you can't, oh, it wouldn't let me do it before. Maybe it was the size of the window I had. I tried it at one, I tried seeing how responsive it was at 1,000 pixels. And it really wasn't. And I tried to grab the middle of the bar to see if it would be grabby and let me resize it. And it didn't. But maybe I just missed it. I'll go back and check that. But now that I'm trying to do it, now that I'm at a 1,280 wide browser window, it lets me do it just fine. Anyway, so I can select what repo I wanted in. I connected it to GitHub. I can connect to the repo, but I can't select the branch. Of course, I can ask it to switch branches. But I don't think I've ever seen a tool that didn't let you specify the branch. Of course, I don't really use a lot of the other AI integrations either. I just don't like their pricing approaches. I like that Anthropic lets me have an account, a singular account. And I can just pull from that however I use it. It's not true of the GitHub side of doing the security checks and stuff like that. Then you have to have Anthropic credits like everyone else. So I don't do that, which I probably should. Anyway, so getting back to the UI, there's the two things. And there's also a button to create a PR. And when I hover over it, it says no remote branch yet. But it is a remote branch, because it's in my GitHub account. And I have it locally. So I don't know what remote means in this case, if not that. There's a copy button next to it. It doesn't work. There's a create PR button that doesn't work. An open CLI button also does not work. And that's fine. I think that's fair to say those are advanced features that I shouldn't actually expect just yet. The copy, I mean, it's a copy in a browser that's not hard. I also noticed that when it was giving me code snippets to execute, I could not copy those either. I had to double click and in some cases drag to make the selection to paste it over into VS Code. It does not have the ability to attach files. I think out of everything, that was the most disappointing for me, because I do so much communication with all the AI tools by grabbing screenshots and pasting them into the chat windows.

And again, it's a preview. And I imagine most developers probably aren't screenshot happy. They've probably got text-based ways that they're doing all this stuff, and they're used to working with text. Whereas I don't know all the fancy bells and whistles in VS Code or any other IDE. So that gets to be a pain when I have to move large chunks of text out of my terminal window. But at the end of the day, it got the job done. And it only cost me 11 credits out of 1,000. So I'm a happy camper. That was pretty great. The only real, I mean, the only real hiccup was forgetting to pull. But and now I'm moving on to another piece of work I've been doing with Cloud Code locally. I wanted to see if it could pick up on that.

And I'll probably come back and talk about that later. But I will throw out right now that I asked it if it's able to see and work with the subagents. And it wasn't specific. And it picked, it found Crew AI and referenced that it was able to see and work with the subagents. Stem as subagents, instead of the subagents in the .cloud folder.

So now I'm super curious if does it see the Cloud MD? I don't know. Anyway, something else for me to look into after a little bit. But I should probably do some work now.
