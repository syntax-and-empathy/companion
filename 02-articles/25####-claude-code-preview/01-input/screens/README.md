## How to Navigate

### Recommended Path

**For the complete experience:**
1. Start by browsing the screenshots in chronological order (by filename timestamp) to follow the sequence of interactions.
2. Then, refer back to these visuals while reading the main article for contextual understanding.

### Alternative Paths

**If you're short on time:** Skim through the filenames to identify key timestamps or browse the first few and last few images for an overview.
**If you're looking for specific information:** Use your file browser's preview mode to quickly scan thumbnails for relevant visual cues.
**If you want visual context first:** Simply open the images directly to get a sense of the interaction flow before reading the main analysis.

**Tip:** The timestamps in the filenames (`YYYY-MM-DD at HH.MM.SS PM.png`) provide a chronological order for reviewing the interactions.
