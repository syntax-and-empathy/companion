## Navigation Guide

### Where to Start

**If you're looking for the visual context given to Claude:** Start with `screens/`
**If you're interested in the actual AI interaction logs:** Check out `sessions/`
**If you want to understand the complete input process:** Explore `screens/` first, then proceed to `sessions/`.

### How to Explore

- **By interest:** Each subdirectory is self-contained and focuses on a specific type of input.
- **Sequentially:** It's recommended to view the visual inputs (`screens/`) before diving into the AI sessions (`sessions/`) to provide proper context.

**Tip:** Each subdirectory has its own README with detailed information about its contents.

<summary><strong>Structure & Logic</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

### Organizational Approach

- **Thematic:** Content is grouped by the type of input material: visual assets (`screens/`) and conversational logs (`sessions/`). This separation ensures clarity and ease of access for specific data types.

### Naming Convention

- Subdirectories are named descriptively to clearly indicate their content.
- Individual files within subdirectories follow specific naming conventions (e.g., `YYMMDD-description.png` for screenshots, `session-N.md` for session logs) to maintain order and traceability.

### Content Types

- **Visual Assets:** Screenshots, code snippets rendered as images, UI mockups.
- **Text Logs:** Markdown files containing AI prompts, responses, and user annotations.
