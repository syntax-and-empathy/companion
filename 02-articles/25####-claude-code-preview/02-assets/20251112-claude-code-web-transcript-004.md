Okay, it is the day after I started with Cloud Code. I managed to get it to do some small tasks, a small task actually, which it did fine. I moved on to a much larger task trying to get it to build some of the verticals in the SEO crew AI flow, and it choked several times. I had stopped last night with the impression that the issue was something to do with the branches. Apparently the web version is required to create a branch in a certain format, which I didn't know at the beginning. And somewhere in there, I think I gave it, I requested for it to look at a thing, like test, not test, but examine the code, do a code review or something like that. And then I asked it to document it. And I think it had a problem with the fact it wasn't on, it had done the action in the normal branch. And when I asked it to do it, and it did an action. Yeah. And when I asked it to make the change, it, I think it got, I thought it got stuck. But then I tried doing it in new sessions with new branches. And each time it choked and it looked like, like it did all of the work, but never committed it. And at least one of the task lists, I'll have to check, it took a lot of screenshots. I'll have to check those. But it looked like the task list got to the commit state marked it as done. So I think that it did the work and didn't make the commit. I also had noticed, and this is part of the, I guess this is part of the working theory now. I noticed that I was easily down to less, 100 credits less than I have right now. And they have come back and I don't know why. So I have to assume it's something to do with whatever failure took place. I've taken a number of screenshots. I'll have more detail once I go back through those, because I had, at the point that I was doing that, I had kind of given up on it and was just trying to get it to go forward in between games of Destiny 2. So I have, I still have both of those things in my queue and they both act like they want to work. But every time I open them, I get a reset connection. I've got a third project going now. That's again, much smaller things like right now I have it doing, checking for issues in my existing tools. And I already knew of several that were not that big of a deal. So I have it going through and changing the ones that look beneficial. I'm gonna have it reorganized. It looks like it's doing okay, but I haven't seen it commit yet. So we'll see what happens. Actually, it did do a commit of the document when it updated the issues document. So I have seen it commit. Just not a big one. It was a single markdown file. So I'm gonna leave the other two running. I mean, it's not hurting anything as far as I can tell. And maybe, maybe they break free tomorrow, whatever. I mean, I've got over 950 credits. So my God, I got credits to burn. I don't I don't really know what to do with this thing if it can't do big tasks. Yeah, so that's it. Nothing else to say on that one at the moment, but we'll see what happens.
