so it's the evening of the last time I left a message here and I've just made a new session it wasn't it wasn't moving forward so I gave Claude the new thing the new session the new thing told it to look at it it claims it fixed everything which I doubt I'm gonna find out is true I'm getting it into Colab now but it committed and I just now realized and it mentioned there being a PR and it gave a link which is the first time I saw the link so I hit the link and PRs are working now so that's pretty great I can only assume that open and CLI is is working too but it's not really something I need at the moment so I might look at it later I might just continue to not care because they don't use it I wouldn't use it like this anyway I can see how an engineer developer on the go whatever might want to use it but that's not me I am loading up the articles right now so hmm I think that's really all I have to say I don't expect this to work it might I guess it doesn't hurt for me to keep the mic on while I check it out won't take long I imagine so we got our articles there in the environment now let's make sure it can get to the hugging face token because somehow that always seems to be turned off it keeps adding this open and Colab link it being clawed code it never works in fact it's probably the reason that github's telling me it's an invalid a notebook alright so we're running the first expected error cell one never makes it always have to go after after that and run the next thing it looks like it's stripped out cell zero zero one which was checking to make sure that everything was loaded so I guess we got to find out the hard way now run cell and below so this will take a bit a little bit
failed at dot six somehow we always end up going back to failing a dot fucking six so what that tells me is the new session went and undid all the fucking shit it did and I'm back at square whatever with probably ten errors that we're gonna have to work through again so that's fucking great yeah I'm just gonna tell it it fucked up and see what I get out of that
