Okay, we're on day three, maybe four, of working with Cloud Code on the web. When I set it aside for a while, I had it working on Soylent Green, the SEO project, and it would keep doing entire verticals, and it looked like it had finished the verticals and was getting hung up on trying to commit. Now, it's clearly been set up to always set up a branch using the specific naming convention, so I theorized that maybe there was something about how it had been instructed to create a branch, do commits, because it does a lot of commits, which is good, but when it's working on the verticals, it wasn't doing periodic commits. I think it's after every time it completes a task, it commits, and it was doing the entire vertical as a task, which maybe I should have told it to plan, I would think it would. It doesn't have the same controls as they see in the IDE. There's a lot of other things, like there's no ability to put files in that I've been able to identify, which has been a godsend in the IDE. Every time it says something's not true, I give it a screenshot, and we're off to the races again. You don't have that in the web version. I think I already talked about how some of the interface is confusing. There's two text entries. One seems to be to start a session. The other one is to work in a session, but because of how they're placed, you lose half the screen. So until you have like 20 different sessions, I'm not sure why that makes sense, and I don't know why they didn't have like a little fly out like they have in their app. There's no copy for code blocks it gives you, but anyway, so I picked it up again today, or I had it do a couple small tasks, and I think all of this is in the last recording, and it did fine. Today I picked it up again, and instead of working on the SEO project, which I just didn't want to, I'd already had Cloud Code in the IDE start working on it again, so I didn't want to try and juggle those. So I put it on the SEO or the latest version of the Authenticities tool that I'd been working with, ChatGPT. So I had the three roles that I'd been using there, and it was in a different one of my repositories, so I still have that file, thankfully.
Cloud Code has gone through and made extensive edits. We're starting to see some of the same issues that I had seen early on with the version I originally gave it, and what I think happened is I think it went, it made the edits and probably put it back the way that it used to be, thinking that's how it should be, because that's where we started with GPT-2. So anyway, so we've gone through, we've done a lot of work. It's actually, I was having it give me all the code and code blocks instead of trying to commit, and we made it a long ways, and then I forgot to tell it that once, and so it made a commit, but it made the commit. So I kept having it give me the code in code blocks, because I have Colab open right next to it in DIA, so they're sharing a window panel by panel, and we got to a point where we'd had the same problems around getting libraries loaded and that kind of thing, so we weren't really getting past the zero dot steps, and the last change, it shot all the way down to 6.3, which is fantastic, and I have not been looking at the output, so I don't even know what I've got here. There are a lot of, it looks like it's putting all the folders out in advance. These all seem to be empty. Diagnostics has something, ENV has some JSON, module one is empty.
Yeah, so I don't think there's anything in any of these modules that it's created. NLTK has some files in it. Burstiness, oh, we've got some. Oh, that radar overlay looks great. That's fantastic. So, getting images down in here after away semantic, I have JSON for semantics. It looks like I've got charts for the spaCy measurements, or the ones that come from spaCy.
Text, stat, looks like there's probably more there. I'm not going to bother with them. That's probably sentence counts and lengths and all that, but then despite giving me the code blocks, I hit the barrier of Claude code, giving me the retry connection thing, and I did see this earlier today, and I was doing something in the other window next to it, so I didn't do anything to that, and it recovered. So, I don't know if this is going to recover or not. So, I've got some other tasks that I've got to do. I'm going to move on to those, but
the authenticity tool is still not getting as far as it was before. There are some errors coming out prior to where it's getting to. I think there was a somewhere in four, there was information not found in five forward saying run cell five, three, five, three, skipped, oh, five, three, B.
No articles versions found, skipping module five processing. That's in cell five, three, cell five, three, which is weird because I thought we, yeah, it's having a problem with directories, I think, because we already tried fixing that once. I might be able to fix that one myself at this point, and then it looks like module four validation failed, output file not found, and then I saw that file in the output. Perplexity, perplexity.
Where are you? Oh, maybe I didn't. Maybe I was mistaking burstiness for it. Yeah, I think I mistake burstiness for it, so we didn't get that syntax discourse.
Yeah, we're not, we're not getting that yet, and that, I don't know what that comes from module four validation. Oh, this is for, no perplexity, we're run for three first. Yeah, this is just cascading, no article, because it's not finding the articles, so none of these things are key. Okay, so it's not finding the articles, which is not stopping a lot of these cells from running, and then they have apparently been set up to look at the cell before them,
and they say, oh, I don't have that, I'm just going to keep going, but it all seems to stem back to not finding the actual files, so I'm going to try and hunt that down myself. I've been looking at so much Python, I might be able to, and we'll see if Claude recovers. If not, I'll go do something else for a while and see if it ever comes back, but I don't know. There is so much that we've done in this session that it's probably just choked.
I mean, I think I'm actually seeing issues with context, window two, but it's all still here, so maybe I'll see if I can capture that and see what happens later, I guess. But for now, I guess I got other stuff I need to do anyway.
