### Purpose & Context

These logs are intended to offer transparent, qualitative data on the practical application of AI in technical design workflows. They explore:
- The main theme of AI-assisted coding, specifically through the lens of Claude Code's web interface.
- The approach involves a "think-aloud" method, where the user records their observations, instructions to the AI, and reflections on the AI's responses and actions.
- Key insights include the learning curve of interacting with a new AI coding tool, the importance of clear communication, and the resilience required to navigate beta software limitations.
- The intended audience includes design leaders, technical designers, AI product managers, and researchers keen on understanding the human-AI collaboration dynamic in code development.
- This content fits into the broader context of the `25####-claude-code-preview` article by providing the foundational, unedited source material that informs the analysis and conclusions presented elsewhere.

### Background

The logs originated from a series of experimental sessions conducted shortly after the Claude Code web preview was made available. The user, a design professional with some coding background but not a professional developer, aimed to test its capabilities on real-world projects, including reversing a Gmail collector's logic, building SEO verticals, and developing an AI/Human text detection pipeline (the "Authenticities tool"). The motivation was to document the unvarnished experience of adopting a new AI tool for complex technical tasks.

### AI-Assisted Coding in Beta
These logs meticulously document the functionality and debugging of the Claude Code preview environment across two main projects: an initial SEO task ("Soylent Green") and the more complex AI/Human Text Detection Pipeline ("Authenticities tool"). They detail numerous technical challenges, including initial interface limitations (e.g., inability to upload files or copy code), unexpected repository actions (e.g., committing files to incorrect locations), and significant stability issues within the coding environment itself, often related to dependency errors, memory exhaustion, and incorrectly configured libraries.

### Human-AI Collaboration Dynamics
The transcripts capture the iterative process of fixing issues, such as resolving recursive file scanning that caused code execution to hang, correcting the initialization of tools, and systematically updating notebook cells to ensure proper package installation and file path management. They illustrate the back-and-forth communication, the user's attempts to guide the AI, and the AI's responses and adaptations, providing a detailed observational study of the AI's collaborative coding capabilities as it evolved through active development and debugging.

### Workflow Adaptations
The logs highlight how the user adapted their workflow to the AI's strengths and weaknesses. This includes strategies like asking the AI to provide code blocks instead of committing directly due to commit issues, taking frequent screenshots to capture context for later analysis or re-engagement, and managing credit usage in an evolving beta environment. The evolution of the Claude Code UI and features (e.g., working PR and CLI buttons) is also noted, demonstrating how the tool itself changed during the testing period.
