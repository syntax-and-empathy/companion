### Purpose & Context

This content explores the main theme of human-AI collaboration in software development and debugging. It investigates:
- The performance of the Claude Code Web Preview, an AI development environment, in completing a complex 12-module Jupyter notebook project.
- The AI's ability to diagnose and fix critical issues in a non-functional Python application (Soylent Green SEO Intelligence Engine).
- Key insights into the AI's high-level logical capabilities versus its tendencies to introduce foundational setup bugs and struggle with platform instability.
- The importance of detailed logging, transcripts, and timelines in understanding and evaluating AI's developmental process.
The intended audience includes design leaders, developers, and AI/ML practitioners interested in the practicalities and challenges of integrating AI into technical workflows. This content directly supports the broader "Syntax & Empathy Companion" repository by providing a concrete case study on AI collaboration.

### Background

The projects documented here took place during the "research preview" phase of Claude Code for Web, primarily in November 2025. This context is crucial as it frames the observations within an early-access, beta environment, acknowledging inherent instabilities and evolving features. The motivation was to rigorously test and document an advanced AI's capabilities in a real-world, complex coding scenario, providing an impartial assessment of its strengths and weaknesses as a development partner.
