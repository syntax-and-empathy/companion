### Purpose & Context

This collection aims to provide transparent, first-hand accounts of engaging with a cutting-edge AI coding environment. It explores:
- The iterative process of debugging and developing with an AI collaborator.
- The evolution of the AI's capabilities and the web interface over a short period.
- Specific technical challenges encountered, such as dependency management, environment instability, and UI limitations.
- The value of detailed logging and analysis in understanding AI performance in real-world scenarios.
This content is intended for anyone seeking to ground their understanding of AI-assisted development in concrete, documented experiences.

### Background

The files originated from a user's early access to Claude Code's web-based research preview. Faced with $1,000 in credits to utilize within a limited timeframe, the user embarked on several coding projects, most notably an "Authenticities tool" (AI/human text detection pipeline) and an "SEO project" (Soylent Green Intelligence Engine). These recordings and subsequent analyses capture the day-to-day interactions, frustrations, breakthroughs, and learning moments of collaborating with an AI in an evolving beta environment.

<summary><strong>Detailed Topic Breakdown</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

### AI-Assisted Debugging
The transcripts provide granular details of debugging sessions, where Claude Code was tasked with fixing non-functional Python applications and refining complex Jupyter notebooks. This includes identifying root causes, proposing solutions, and the iterative process of applying fixes and validating outcomes, often complicated by the AI's own introduced errors or environmental misunderstandings.

### AI Capabilities & Limitations
This section highlights the dual nature of AI in coding: its capacity for high-level architectural planning and complex logical transformations, juxtaposed with its frequent failures in basic environmental configuration, dependency management, and persistent memory across sessions. The content illustrates how the AI functioned as a "highly capable but intermittently distracted architect."

### Web UI Experience
The documentation details the evolution of the Claude Code web interface, from an initial state lacking critical features like file uploads, code copying, and functional PR/CLI buttons, to observing these features become active over the course of the preview. User frustrations with session stability, text entry layouts, and feedback mechanisms are also thoroughly recorded.
