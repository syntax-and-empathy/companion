### Historical Use of Screenshots
Traditionally, screenshots have been a primary method for sharing design progress, gaining stakeholder approval, and documenting personal work. Their usage was often constrained by the design tools and development processes of the time, focusing on communicating finished designs or critical layouts.

### Evolution of Design Tools
The content traces the evolution of design tools, from early practices of designing a few key screens and then moving directly to HTML, to modern tools like Sketch and Figma that enable complete, clickable prototypes. Despite these advancements, the fundamental act of communicating design often still revolves around sequences of "wired-together screenshots."

### AI's Multimodal Capabilities
A significant portion of the content introduces how AI's multimodal capabilities are opening new possibilities. Screenshots are no longer just static images but can serve as dynamic inputs for AI to process and interpret, transforming their utility in the design process.

### AI-driven Information Architecture
The article highlights a practical application where AI can infer information architecture (IA) directly from screenshots of entire workflows. This capability, even if 80% accurate for complex flows, represents a significant time-saver for designers, potentially reducing weeks of manual work to days.
